        <h2>HISTORY MADE IN DAYTONA</h2>

        <p>The Daytona 500 was first run in 1959, but its roots can be traced all the way back to 1903. That was the year some hardy sorts decided that the level, hard-packed sands of Ormond Beach, Florida, would be a perfect place to see how fast a race car could run. From there, beach racing in the Daytona area became a hit.</p>
        <p>A mechanic named France founded NASCAR (the National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing) and began to bring order to what previously had been an untamed sport. Since France lived in Daytona and his big track also was located there, it made sense to have NASCAR headquartered in the Florida town, too.</p>

        <p>Daytona has proven to be an ideal site for the nerve center of NASCAR. The Daytona 500 opens the NASCAR season each February, a time of year when many other tracks around the country are paved in ice and snow. Daytona offers race fans a chance to escape the winter and soak up some sun, surf, and speed. Approximately 200,000 fans make the Daytona 500 an annual sellout.</p>
        <p>Daytona International Speedway hosts a second NASCAR race each year during the Fourth of July weekend. But even though it's on the same track and has the same cars and drivers, it's not the same race. There are other horse races at Churchill Downs, but there's only one Kentucky Derby. The same logic applies to Daytona.</p>
        <p>"For a race driver, when you drive through that tunnel and into the infield at Daytona, it's like you've entered the gates of heaven," says 1989 Daytona 500 winner Darrell Waltrip. "If you roll onto the track at Daytona and don't get goose bumps, buddy, you ain't a racer."</p>
